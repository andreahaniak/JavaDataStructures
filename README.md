JavaDataStructures
==================

Simple examples of Data Structures and Algorithms written in Java.

Topics I intend to cover (this will be updated and links added as I complete them):

- Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
- Sorting
  - [Quicksort](https://github.com/jonstaff/JavaDataStructures/blob/master/src/com/jonstaff/java/sort/QuickSort.java)
  - [Mergesort](https://github.com/jonstaff/JavaDataStructures/blob/master/src/com/jonstaff/java/sort/MergeSort.java)
- Hashtables
- Trees
  - [Binary](https://github.com/jonstaff/JavaDataStructures/blob/master/src/com/jonstaff/java/tree/BinaryTree.java)
  - n-ary
  - Trie-trees
  - Balanced binary
    - Red/black
    - Splay
    - AVL
  - Traversal algorithms
    - Breadth first search
    - Depth first search
    - inorder, postorder, preorder
- Graphs
  - Using objects and pointers
  - Using matrices
  - Using and adjacency list
  - Traversal algorithms
- NP-complete problems
  - Traveling salesman
  - Knapsack problem
